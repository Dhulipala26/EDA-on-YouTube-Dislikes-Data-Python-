# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on YouTube Dislikes Data (Python)

This project performs a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on trending YouTube videos collected from **August 2020 to December 2021**, focusing on engagement metrics — especially **dislike counts**, which were hidden from public view by YouTube in late 2021.

Leveraging Python’s powerful libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, this analysis uncovers trends in **video popularity**, **monthly publishing patterns**, and the **correlation between views, likes, and dislikes** across content from the **USA, Canada, and Great Britain**.

## 🎯 Objective

To perform comprehensive data analysis on the YouTube Dislikes Dataset using Python and derive meaningful insights as part of the **Great Learning Data Analytics Course**. The goal was to apply real-world EDA techniques and storytelling with data.

## 📁 Dataset

**Name:** YouTube Dislikes Dataset  
**Source:** Provided by the Great Learning course  
**Time Range:** August 2020 to December 2021  
**Regions Covered:** USA, Canada, Great Britain  
**Note:** The dataset captures dislike counts just before YouTube removed public access to them (December 13, 2021).

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📈 **Views vs. Dislikes:** A moderate positive correlation was found — highly viewed videos also tend to attract more dislikes.
- 🏆 **Top Channels:** Identified the top 10 channels with the most trending videos; some consistently published viral content.
- 📅 **Publishing Patterns:** Certain months (e.g., January, October) had higher volumes of published videos, indicating seasonal trends.
- 👍👎 **Engagement Extremes:** Videos with the maximum and minimum likes/dislikes were highlighted, offering a look at audience extremes.
- 🔢 **Unique Entities:** Counted unique `video_id`, `channel_id`, and `channel_title` to assess dataset diversity.
- 🗂️ **Monthly Breakdown:** Videos were grouped by publishing month to understand content activity over time.
